Wayne State University Shuttle Tracking System
================================================

Wayne State University's campus shuttle tracking application for Android is being built to retrieve and update the location details with ETA (Estimate time of arrival).

The Universtiy is trying to improve and increase their transportation services within the campus by getting more users on board with help of such tracking systems.

The Project is currently in progress and will be updated timely.

The WSUshuttle website created by a student of the University provides live information about the shuttle and its ETA
